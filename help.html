            <h1>How to play.</h1>
            <p>Checkers is a two-player strategy game played on either an 8x8 or 10x10 board. 
                In the 8x8 version, each player starts with 12 pieces on dark squares, either black or light-colored.
                However, in the 10x10 version, each player begins with 20 pieces. Players take turns moving diagonally,
                capturing opponents' pieces by jumping over them. Regular pieces become kings when reaching the opposite end, 
                allowing backward moves. Capturing is mandatory when possible. The game ends when a player captures
                all opponent pieces or blocks them from legal moves. Draw conditions include mutual agreement, 
                repetitive positions, or 50 consecutive moves without captures. The player with 
                no remaining pieces or legal moves loses.</p>
