# Checkers Project CSCI 130
- ABOUT PROJECT 

This was a project assigned in the class "CSCI 130: Web Programming" at CSU Fresno. The purpose of this project is to implement
a website with both client and server side, using a RDBMS. HTML5 with forms, CSS3, Javascript, and PHP will be used to implement
a dynamic website. This website should allow a user to play the game checkers, either against another local player or alone with
a bot. The website should include a help page, contact page, and leaderboard page. The systems to be implemented are the checkers
game, login system, options to modify how the pieces or board looks, single/multiplayer modes, and game state notifications.
