        <!-- Only modify this page and game.js, or you can add more files as needed. This is 
        to ensure that we don't have merge conflicts. We need to dynamically create a game, so for now
        use the button below to create a game. We need 8x8 and 10x10 boards. For now, just create a 8x8 board.
        Also add pieces to the board. We need to be able to move the pieces, so make sure you can move the pieces.
        The pieces should snap to the center of the square. On hover, highlight the square green if it is a valid move, highlight red
        if the square is not a valid move. Delete pieces that die. In general just add all the rules to the game, and when a game is finished.
        Just display a message saying which player won. The player on the bottom = player 1. The player on top = player 2.
        Future tasks - keep in mind when coding
        - Allow for singleplayer (second player is AI - just make random valid moves)
        - Allow for pieces and the board to be different colors/textures. (dynamic css tags)
        - Button that restarts game
        -->
        <button onclick="createGame()">Create Game</button>
